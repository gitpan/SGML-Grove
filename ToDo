 * get feedback from developers (that's YOU!) on what they need most

Otherwise,

 * bugs
  ** Simple: not recording errors
  ** RPM spec doesn't work with Perl 5.004 MakeMaker

 * functionality
  ** record ends are carriage returns
  ** SimpleSpec: cascading specs
  ** create test suite
  ** do more useful things with Entitys
  ** Writer needs more intelligence
  ** Simple forces a dependency on SGML::SPGroveBuilder and SP
  ** More objects
   - SGML::NonSGMLData
   - SGML::Comment
   - SGML::Whitespace
   - SGML specific objects (marked sections, for example)

 * projects
  ** Unicode
  ** create Document Object Model <http://www.w3.org/DOM/> layer
  ** more examples

 * issues
  ** should SData be CharEntity or not even a special case of Entity?
